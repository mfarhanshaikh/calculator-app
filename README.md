## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time Calculation** — Instantly evaluates expressions as you type with clean display output.
- **Chained Operations** — Supports consecutive operations without pressing `=` in between.
- **Decimal Support** — Handles floating-point numbers with duplicate-dot prevention.
- **Smart Delete** — `DEL` button removes the last digit; auto-resets to `0` when empty.
- **All Clear** — `AC` resets the entire calculator state in one tap.
- **Glassmorphism Design** — Frosted glass UI with backdrop blur, soft borders, and layered shadows.
- **Hover & Click Animations** — Smooth `translateY` lift on hover and `scale` press effect on click.
- **Responsive Layout** — Centered, fixed-width design optimized for all screen sizes.
